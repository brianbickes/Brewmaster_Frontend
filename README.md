# Brewmaster_Frontend

BREWMASTER APP

For this project, I used a Rails backend to connect to my postgres database, I used faker to seed the data for my coffee types. I also used cors in order for the backend to be able to speak to the backend. The front end is made with react and utilized useState. My front end is able to consume my backend and the frontedn displays the data from my back end. Create is able to be used on the front end and the update and delete cna be accessed on the backend through the rails console and I can succesfully update and delete my data through there.
